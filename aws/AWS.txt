it is a cloud base service which provides different services as per our neeed and it is based on pay on demand and use
we have to pay for the time we used , it is like a something we use on rent and pay only for howmuch we use

Example:
company like a flipkart which has 1M visitors on normal days but when it has a sale there are 20M visitors so , to handle that much of visitors ,
it has to setup many extra devices , servers, networks and all which is very costly , and that is also a fact that these nuch of trafffic is only on sale
so for short period of time it is not worthy  to invest that much of money , so in such case this cloud service is useful and many companies do that 

so, AWS provides us such IT related services on demand and we have have to pay whatever we use,
